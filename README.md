# Launchpad Namespaces

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

## Introduction

*Launchpad Namespaces*, part of the *Launchpad Toolkit*, leverages [*Helmfile*](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile) to offer a declarative way for deploying and managing functionally related bundles of [helm charts](https://github.com/helm/helm) (called *releases* in *helmfile*).
It aims to:
- be easy to use, while extensible and adaptable
- provide sensible working defaults that can always be overriden
- service the requirements of Launchpad and GraphOps

## Features

- Actively maintained by [![GraphOps](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85314764?s=12&v=4) *GraphOps*](https://graphops.xyz) [and contributors](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces/graphs/contributors)
- Common values interfaces across all namespaces
- Flexible and adaptable, allowing defaults to be overriden
- Two release channels: `main` and `canary`
- A large selection of Namespaces (listed below)

## Getting Started

> **Note**
> [~~*Launchpad Starter*~~ support for *Namespaces* will be available soon](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-starter) is a great way to make use of *Namespaces* and worth checking out

To use *Namespaces* you will require both a [*Kubernetes*](https://kubernetes.io) cluster and [*Helmfile*](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile).
As such:
- Make sure your *Kubernetes* *Cluster* is in order and your environment has the *kubeconfig* context adequately setup
- Install *helmfile*, upstream guidance available here: [*Helmfile* Installation](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile#installation)

Next, setup an `helmfile.yaml` file that makes use of the storage *Namespace* by creating it with the following contents:
```yaml
helmfiles:
  - path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage:latest
    selectorsInherited: true
```

This is a very minimalist helmfile but enough to get it done.
Proceed by running `helmfile`:
```shell
helmfile sync -i
```

After some output, you should be greeted by a prompt like this:
> Do you really want to sync?
>   Helmfile will sync all your releases, as shown above.
>
>  [y/n]:

Answer yes and hopefully the installation will conclude successfully.

### a shot exaplantion on selecting the ?ref

add more quick examples:
### pass some values

### use features

### use values

### mention how to install multiple namespaces

## Updates

- use version bumping tools
- latest and latest-canary moving tags
