- list of namespaces?

## Getting Started

Please see the [Quick Start](https://docs.graphops.xyz/launchpad/quick-start) guide in the [Documentation](https://docs.graphops.xyz/launchpad/intro).

- example usage with helmfile

## Updates

- use version bumping tools
- latest and latest-canary moving tags

## Namespaces

For deploying ethereum mainnet and g√∂erli archive nodes

- [erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon)
Erigon is an implementation of Ethereum (execution client with light client for consensus layer), on the efficiency frontier.
- [nimbus](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2)

### [ingress](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces/ingress)
Adds ingress support and certificate management on kubernetes

- [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager)

Helm chart for Grafana Loki in microservices mode
- [node-problem-detector](https://github.com/deliveryhero/helm-charts/tree/master/stable/node-problem-detector)
This chart installs a node-problem-detector daemonset. This tool aims to make various node problems visible to the upstream layers in cluster management stack.
- [promtail](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/promtail)
Promtail is an agent which ships the contents of local logs to a Loki instance
### [postgres operator](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces/postgres-operator)
