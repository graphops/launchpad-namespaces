# Launchpad Namespaces

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

## Introduction

*Launchpad Namespaces*, part of the *Launchpad Toolkit*, leverages [*Helmfile*](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile) to offer a declarative way for deploying and managing functionally related bundles of [helm charts](https://github.com/helm/helm) (called *releases* in *helmfile*).

It aims to:
- be easy to use, while extensible and adaptable
- provide sensible working defaults that can always be overriden
- service the requirements of Launchpad and GraphOps

## Features

- Actively maintained by [![GraphOps](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85314764?s=12&v=4) *GraphOps*](https://graphops.xyz) [and contributors](/graphs/contributors)
- Common values interfaces across all namespaces
- Flexible and adaptable, allowing defaults to be overriden
- Two release channels: `main` and `canary`
- A large selection of Namespaces (listed below)

## Getting Started

> **Note**
> [~~*Launchpad Starter*~~ support for *Namespaces* will be available soon](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-starter) is a great way to make use of *Namespaces* and worth checking out

To use *Namespaces* you will require both a [*Kubernetes*](https://kubernetes.io) cluster and [*Helmfile*](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile).
As such:
- Make sure your *Kubernetes* *Cluster* is in order and your environment has the *kubeconfig* context adequately setup
- Install *helmfile*, upstream guidance available here: [*Helmfile* Installation](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile#installation)

Next, setup an `helmfile.yaml` file that makes use of the storage *Namespace* by creating it with the following contents:
```yaml
helmfiles:
  - path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage:latest
    selectorsInherited: true
```

> **Note**
> On the path to the helmfile, you can use the query string's ref `(?ref=storage:latest)` to track one of the release streams: `main` and `canary`, pin to a specific version or just track a particular major or minor semantic version.
> For more on this, check the [*Updates*](/README.md#Updates) section

This is a very minimalist helmfile but enough to get it done.
Proceed by running `helmfile`:
```shell
helmfile sync -i
```

After some output, you should be greeted by a prompt like this:
> Do you really want to sync?
>   Helmfile will sync all your releases, as shown above.
>
>  [y/n]:

Answer 'y' and hopefully the installation will conclude successfully.

### overriding namespace and releases' `values`

To customize the configuration and deployment, you can pass values to override the default helmfile configuration like so:
```yaml
helmfiles:
  - path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage:latest
    selectorsInherited: true
    values:
      targetNamespace: "i-choose-my-own-namespace"
      labels:
        awesome.label.key/stuff: "yes"
        awesome.label.key/thing: "kind-of-thing"
```

where we add some labels to this *Namespace* releases, and set it to be deployed on cluster namespace different from default.

You can also easilly override values for every release, like so:
```yaml
helmfiles:
  - path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage:latest
    selectorsInherited: true
    values:
      targetNamespace: "i-choose-my-own-namespace"
      labels:
        awesome.label.key/stuff: "yes"
        awesome.label.key/thing: "kind-of-thing"
      <release-name>:
        - akey: value
          bkey: value
```

Check out the *Namespaces* [list](/README.md#namespaces) below for release names, and each chart's folder for its specific values interface.

To use multiple namespaces on the same cluster, just add more items to the helmfiles array like so:
```yaml
helmfiles:
  - path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage:latest
    selectorsInherited: true
    values:
      <storage values>
  - path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@<other namespace>/helmfile.yaml?ref=<other namespace>:latest
    selectorsInherited: true
    values:
      <other values>
```
