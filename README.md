# Launchpad Namespaces

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

## Introduction

*Launchpad Namespaces*, part of the *Launchpad Toolkit*, leverages [*Helmfile*](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile) to offer a declarative way for deploying and managing functionally related bundles of [helm charts](https://github.com/helm/helm) (called *releases* in *helmfile*).

It aims to:
- be easy to use, while extensible and adaptable
- provide sensible working defaults that can always be overridden
- service the requirements of Launchpad and GraphOps

## Features

- Actively maintained by [![GraphOps](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85314764?s=12&v=4) *GraphOps*](https://graphops.xyz) [and contributors](/graphs/contributors)
- Common values interfaces across all namespaces
- Flexible and adaptable, allowing defaults to be overridden
- Two release channels: `stable` and `canary`
- A large selection of Namespaces (listed below)

## Getting Started

> **Note**
> [*Launchpad Starter*](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-starter) is a great way to make use of *Namespaces* and worth checking out as a starting point for every new *Launchpad* deployment.

To use *Namespaces* you will require both a [*Kubernetes*](https://kubernetes.io) cluster and [*Helmfile*](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile).
As such:
- Make sure your *Kubernetes* *Cluster* is in order and your environment has the *kubeconfig* context adequately setup
- Install *helmfile*, upstream guidance available here: [*Helmfile* Installation](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile#installation)
– Install *kustomize*, upstream guidance available here: [*Kustomize* Installation](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/). Although `launchpad–namespaces` doesn't explicitly use *kustomize*, it is a dependency for utilising *helmfile* features.

Next, setup an `helmfile.yaml` file that makes use of the storage *Namespace* by creating it with the following contents:
```yaml
helmfiles:
  - path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage-latest
    selectorsInherited: true
```

> **Note**
> On the path to the helmfile, you can use the query string's ref `(?ref=storage-latest)` to track one of the release streams: `stable` and `canary`, pin to a specific version or just track a particular major or minor semantic version.
> For more on this, check the [*Updates*](/README.md#Updates) section

This is a very minimalist helmfile but enough to get it done.
Proceed by running `helmfile`:
```shell
helmfile sync -i
```

After some output, you should be greeted by a prompt like this:
> Do you really want to sync?
>   Helmfile will sync all your releases, as shown above.
>
>  [y/n]:

Answer 'y' and hopefully the installation will conclude successfully.

### overriding namespace and releases' `values`

To customize the configuration and deployment, you can pass values to override the default helmfile configuration like so:
```yaml
helmfiles:
  - path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage-latest
    selectorsInherited: true
    values:
      targetNamespace: "i-choose-my-own-namespace"
      labels:
        awesome.label.key/stuff: "yes"
        awesome.label.key/thing: "kind-of-thing"
```

where we add some labels to this *Namespace* releases, and set it to be deployed on cluster namespace different from default.

You can also easily override values for every release, like so:
```yaml
helmfiles:
  - path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage-latest
    selectorsInherited: true
    values:
      targetNamespace: "i-choose-my-own-namespace"
      labels:
        awesome.label.key/stuff: "yes"
        awesome.label.key/thing: "kind-of-thing"
      <release-name>:
        - akey: value
          bkey: value
```

Check out the *Namespaces* [list](/README.md#namespaces) below for release names, and each chart's folder for its specific values interface.

To use multiple namespaces on the same cluster, just add more items to the helmfiles array like so:
```yaml
helmfiles:
  - path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage-latest
    selectorsInherited: true
    values:
      <storage values>
  - path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@<other namespace>/helmfile.yaml?ref=<other namespace>-latest
    selectorsInherited: true
    values:
      <other values>
```

## Updates

You can use git ref's as a means to track what release stream you may want, or to pin to any particular major, minor or patch version.
Continue reading for examples on how to achieve that.

**following latest**:

Your `?ref=` would look like this, for the storage namespace: `?ref=storage-latest`, or alternatively: `?ref=storage-stable/latest`.
The path for this *Namespace*, under helmfiles, would then look like:

```shell
- path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage-latest
```

**following a specific major version**:

Your `?ref=` would look like this, for the storage namespace: `?ref=storage-v1`.
The path for this *Namespace*, under helmfiles, would then look like:

```shell
- path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage-v1
```

**following a specific minor version**:

Your `?ref=` would look like this, for the storage namespace: `?ref=storage-v1.2`.
The path for this *Namespace*, under helmfiles, would then look like:

```shell
- path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage-v1.2
```

**pinning to an exact version**:

Your `?ref=` would look like this, for the storage namespace: `?ref=storage-v1.2.2`.
The path for this *Namespace*, under helmfiles, would then look like:

```shell
- path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage-v1.2.2
```
**following the latest canary**:

Your `?ref=` would look like this, for the storage namespace: `?ref=storage-canary/latest`.
The path for this *Namespace*, under helmfiles, would then look like:

```shell
- path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage-canary/latest
```

We would recommend that you either follow the latest stable releases, or pin to a specific version and use some other means to keep your `helmfile.yaml` updated regularly.
One way to go about that would be to keep it in a git repository on some supported platform, and use a dependency updating bot (like Renovate) to update it or open PRs for achieving that.
