## Introduction

*Launchpad Namespaces*, part of the *Launchpad Toolkit*, leverages {{ const.soft.helmfile.link }} to offer a declarative way for deploying and managing functionally related bundles of [helm charts]({{ const.soft.helm.url }}) (called *releases* in *helmfile*).

It aims to:
- be easy to use, while extensible and adaptable
- provide sensible working defaults that can always be overridden
- service the requirements of Launchpad and GraphOps

## Features

{{ sections::sectionFeatures() }}

## Getting Started

{{ quickstart::namespacesQuickStart(namespace="storage") }}

## Updates

You can use git ref's as a means to track what release stream you may want, or to pin to any particular major, minor or patch version.
Continue reading for examples on how to achieve that.

**following latest**:

Your `?ref=` would look like this, for the storage namespace: `?ref=storage-latest`, or alternatively: `?ref=storage-stable/latest`.
The path for this *Namespace*, under helmfiles, would then look like:

```shell
- path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage-latest
```

**following a specific major version**:

Your `?ref=` would look like this, for the storage namespace: `?ref=storage-v1`.
The path for this *Namespace*, under helmfiles, would then look like:

```shell
- path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage-v1
```

**following a specific minor version**:

Your `?ref=` would look like this, for the storage namespace: `?ref=storage-v1.2`.
The path for this *Namespace*, under helmfiles, would then look like:

```shell
- path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage-v1.2
```

**pinning to an exact version**:

Your `?ref=` would look like this, for the storage namespace: `?ref=storage-v1.2.2`.
The path for this *Namespace*, under helmfiles, would then look like:

```shell
- path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage-v1.2.2
```
**following the latest canary**:

Your `?ref=` would look like this, for the storage namespace: `?ref=storage-canary/latest`.
The path for this *Namespace*, under helmfiles, would then look like:

```shell
- path: git::https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces.git@storage/helmfile.yaml?ref=storage-canary/latest
```

We would recommend that you either follow the latest stable releases, or pin to a specific version and use some other means to keep your `helmfile.yaml` updated regularly.
One way to go about that would be to keep it in a git repository on some supported platform, and use a dependency updating bot (like Renovate) to update it or open PRs for achieving that.

## Namespaces

The following namespaces are supported:

{{ index::renderIndex(schemas=components.schemas) }}
